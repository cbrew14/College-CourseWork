# College 
Coding examples from college in either R, SAS or SQLite.

I no longer have the questions available, so I can't tell you the purpose of every assignment, but I think the examples give you a pretty good estimation of my abilities. Which includes reading in and exporting files of various types in both R and SAS, sorting and collecting data from data bases by using SQLite, and analyizing and modeling data in R, SAS and Excel. I'm sure there is still more to it on top of that. 

And sorry if it is a bit disorganized, I am essentially adding the folders how they are on my PC
